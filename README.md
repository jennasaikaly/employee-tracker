  ## Installation

  To install this application, the user will have to clone the repo from the GitHub page and then use 'npm install' to download the dependencies into the node_modules folder.

  ## Usage 

  Once the application is installed, the user can run the app from the command line using 'node index' or 'node index.js'.  They will then be prompted to answer a series of questions pertaining to their company.  Once they have completed the questions, the application will execute.
